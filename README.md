I was sick of rumbling into different tutorials trying to install the damn thing so, i decided to create this wireframe not only to bootstrap 
my next tailwind - vue3 projects but also to help bootstrap your projects if you feel so incline.
This Project includes Vue 3, Router, Vuex, tailwind, headless ui, heroicons

Enjoy!
